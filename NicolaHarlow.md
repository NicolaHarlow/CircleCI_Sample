# Why use orbs?

CircleCI orbs allow you to reuse code easily. You can use pre-built orbs, or even create your own.
With them you can:
* Automate repeated processes.
* Integrate with third-party tools quickly.
* Reuse code.
* Use parameterizable configuration elements.
* Save time on project configuration.
* Use proven code within your projects again and again.
* Execute shell code from the ob.
* Using pre-built orbs means you can set up processes quickly, with just a few adjustments.
* You can choose the version of the orb you want to use.
* You can keep your orb private, and for your use only.
* Our Orb Development Kit [https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author/#orb-development-kit](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author/#orb-development-kit) gives you all you need to create your own reusable orbs.
